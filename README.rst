DeepSpeech is an open-source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on `Baidu's Deep Speech research paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567>`_. Project DeepSpeech uses Google's `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ to make the implementation easier.

Documentation for installation, usage, and training models are available on `deepspeech.readthedocs.io <https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest>`_.

For the latest release, including pre-trained models and checkpoints, `see the latest release on GitHub <https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/latest>`_.
